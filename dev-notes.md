#### Gotchas working with Rails Authentication
1. `Current.user` will be nil on pages that do not require authentication. To put value, call `authenticate?` before calling `Current.user`
2. To make ViewComponent work with Pundit in views, you have to call `Pundit.policy(Current.user, @record).method?` (ref: https://dev.to/jerryweyer/how-to-get-pundit-to-work-with-rails-view-component-2kdg)
3. In `app/components/avatar_placeholder_component.html.erb`, sometimes `w-#{@size}` does not update CSS properly so to let the browser obtain a cache you have to manually render a chosen size without interpolation e.g. `w-15` then switch back.
